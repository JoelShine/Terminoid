<b>Common errors during installation</b>

You may run into some errors, related to virus. Actually, there is no virus in this program. You can run the program. If you have some Antivirus blocking it, then close the antivirus and try again.

If this screen pops up, you can run anyway as there is no virus or malware in this program.

Inspiration
-----------
The inspiration for this program is the new [Windows Terminal](https://github.com/microsoft/terminal) launched by Microsoft. It was the most beautiful terminal emulator I have ever seen. Completely customizable, the background by setting video or even gif !, the title of the App etc.

So, the main thing that attracted me was that you could change the colour scheme. I scoured through the available python modules, and saw colorama, but we cannot input in colour in colorama. Then I came across [prompt-toolkit](https://github.com/prompt-toolkit/python-prompt-toolkit)

It is a wonderful module. There are many options inculde autocompletion, syntax highlighting and much more.

Special thanks
--------------
Special thanks to microsoft for the [Windows Terminal](https://github.com/microsoft/terminal) and inspiring me to make Terminoid. Thanks to the makers of [prompt-toolkit](https://github.com/prompt-toolkit/python-prompt-toolkit) module for helping me to make this project.
